**An online planner for an employee to set out their tasks for the day.**

**This application uses the Moment.js library to track date and time and updates the page to reflect changes in real time.**

**Time slots turn grey to indicate past, red if the task is current, and finally green to indicate a future task.**

**Simply enter your task into the time slot and press enter or click the blue save icon to store the task.**
